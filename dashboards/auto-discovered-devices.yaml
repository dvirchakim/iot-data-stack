          ## Auto-Discovery System

          This dashboard displays devices and sensors that have been automatically discovered
          by the n8n Auto-Discovery Agent. The system works as follows:

          1. ChirpStack sends device data to the HTTP webhook
          2. The n8n workflow analyzes the data and identifies sensor types
          3. The device and sensors are registered in the device registry
          4. Home Assistant is notified about the new devices/sensors
          5. The dashboard is automatically updated with new entities

          ### Troubleshooting

          If devices are not appearing:
          - Check the n8n logs: `docker-compose logs -f n8n`
          - Verify ChirpStack is sending data to the correct webhook URL
          - Check Home Assistant logs: `docker-compose logs -f homeassistant`
